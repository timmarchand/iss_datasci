## Select ----
## <SEE SLIDES 10~12>
# Select 'year' and 'demVote' (= percentage of vote won by the Democrat)
# from the 'presidentialElections' df

votes <- select(presidentialElections,year,demVote)
## <SEE SLIDE 31>
# select(df,variable_name1, variable_name2)
# Note there are no quotation marks!

#' DIY: complete the following code to make a plot 
#' showing percentage of votes cast for the Democrat 

ggplot(data = ____, aes(x=____,y=____))+



## Advanced 1
# add an alpha argument to show overplotting
# change the color of the points

## Advanced 2
#' make a new  votes df from presidentialElections 
#' to include the names of states

votes <- select()

# use geom_text to add state names as text on the plot

## Advanced 3
# Run the code below.
ggplot(presidentialElections) +
  aes(x = year, y = demVote) +
  geom_point(size = 1L, colour = "#0c4c8a") +
  geom_hline(yintercept=50) +
  facet_wrap(~state)

# Which line of code separated all the states into individual plots?
# Answer:
# What do you think geom_hline(yintercept=50) did?
# Answer:



## Select can also be vectors of column names without using c()

# select columns 'state' through 'year'
select(presidentialElections,state:year)
# select all columns except for 'south'
select(presidentialElections, -south)

## NOTE (OKAY TO SKIP):
## select() on a single column will return a dataframe, not a vector
## If you want a specific column as a vector, use in combination with pull()
select(presidentialElections,state)

select(presidentialElections,state) |>
  pull()

## This is the same as
presidentialElections$state

# Filter ----
## <SEE SLIDES 5~7>
## filter() allows you to choose and extract rows from your dataframe

# Filter only rows from the 2008 election
votes_2008 <- filter(presidentialElections, year == 2008)
## <SEE SLIDE 32>
## filter(df, column_name condition)
## Note the double == for equal to!
## Opposite is != which means NOT equal to


# Extract the row(s) for Colorado in 2008
# Note I've put them on separate lines for readability
votes_colorado_2008 <- filter(
  presidentialElections,
  year == 2008,
  state == "Colorado"
)

## DIY: complete the following code to make a plot showing only states with majority votes cast for the Democrat ----
dem_majority <- filter(presidentialElections, ____ > __)

ggplot(data = _____, aes(x=_____,y=______, label=_____))+
  geom_text()



## Advanced 1
# You can add labels to your x and y axes using another layer:
# labs(x = 'x_axis_label', y = 'y_axis_label')
# Add the labels 'Election Year' and 'Democratic Votes (%)' as a layer
# Don't forget the plus + sign at the end of the geom_text line!


ggplot(data = dem_majority, aes(x=year,y=demVote, label=state)) +
  geom_text() +





## Advanced 2
# What happens when you add the argument check_overlap = TRUE to geom_text
# geom_text(check_overlap= TRUE)?


## Advanced 3
# The final line in a ggplot is a good place to set the theme
# Add theme_minimal() or theme_void() or theme_dark(). What happens?
# Don't forget the plus + sign at the end of the geom_text line!

ggplot(data = dem_mjority, aes(x=year,y=demVote, label=state))+
  geom_text(check_overlap= TRUE) +
  labs(x = 'Election Year', y = 'Democratic Votes (%)')

## DIY: EXTRA FILTERING with the flights dataset ----
## Add comments to explain what is happening!

# What is being filtered here?
#Answer:
alaska_flights <- flights |>
  filter(carrier == "AS")

# What is being filtered here?
#Answer:
portland_flights <- flights |>
  filter(dest == "PDX")
View(portland_flights)

# What do '&' and '|' do ?
#Answer:
btv_sea_flights_fall1 <- flights |>
  filter(origin == "JFK" & (dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA") & month >= 10)

# Do '&' ',' function in the same way ?
#Answer:
btv_sea_flights_fall2 <- flights |>
  filter(origin == "JFK", (dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA"), month >= 10)
glimpse(btv_sea_flights_fall1)

# What does '!' do?
#Answer:
not_BTV_SEA1 <- flights |>
  filter(!(dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA"))

# Is the position of the '(' and '!' important? compare below:
#Answer:
not_BTV_SEA2 <-  flights |> filter(!dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA")

View(not_BTV_SEA1)
View(not_BTV_SEA2)

# Here are a lot of '|' OR and == equal to operators
many_airports1 <- flights |>
  filter(dest == "SEA" | dest == "SFO" | dest == "PDX" |
         dest == "BTV" | dest == "BDL")

# Use %in% operator and a vector instead! Are the results the same?
#Answer:
many_airports2 <- flights |>
  filter(dest %in% c("SEA", "SFO", "PDX", "BTV", "BDL"))
glimpse(many_airports1)
glimpse(many_airports2)

## Filter operators ----
# ==  tests for equality:
# > corresponds to “greater than”
# < corresponds to “less than”
# >= corresponds to “greater than or equal to”
# <= corresponds to “less than or equal to”
# != corresponds to “not equal to.” The ! is used in many programming languages to indicate “not.”

# You can combine multiple criteria using operators that make comparisons:
#   | corresponds to “or”
# & corresponds to “and”

## Mutate ----
## <SEE SLIDES 14~15>

## Mutate allows you to create additional columns for your df

## Add an 'other_parties_vote' column that is a percentage of votes
## for other parties
## Also add an 'abs_vote_difference' column of absolute difference
## between percentages

mutate(
  presidentialElections,
  other_parties_vote = 100 - demVote, # other parties is 100% - Democrat%
  abs_vote_difference = abs(demVote - other_parties_vote) # using the abs() function
)

## Note: mutate doesn't change the df itself, only returns the change
## You need to overwrite your df name to save the changes

presidentialElections <- mutate(
  presidentialElections,
  other_parties_vote = 100 - demVote, # other parties is 100% - Democrat%
  abs_vote_difference = abs(demVote - other_parties_vote) # using the abs() function
)

## DIY: EXTRA Mutate with flights dataset ----

# Remember the temperatures in the weather df were in Farenheit
#Question: what does the new column show?
# Answer:
weather <- weather |>

  mutate(temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8)

  mutate(temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8, .after = year)


#Question: what does the new column in the flights df show?
# Answer:
flights <- flights |>
  mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay)
View(flights)
## Arrange ----
## The arrange () function allows you to sort the rows of your df by some column value
## E.g. sort presidentialElections df by year, then within each year sort by percentage
## vote for democrat

# Arrange rows in decreasing order by 'year', then by 'demVote' within each year
## <SEE SLIDE 33>
presidentialElections <- arrange(presidentialElections, -year, demVote)
presidentialElections <- arrange(presidentialElections, desc(year), demVote) # same as above

# By default, arrange() will sort by increasing order
# Use minus sign (-) or desc() function for descending order

## Summarise ----
## <SEE SLIDES 17~18>
## summarise() (or US spelling summarize()) generates a new df containing a summary of
## a column, computing a single value from a function on the column values

# Compute summary statistics 'mean' for the 'presidentialElections' df
## <SEE SLIDE 34>
average_votes <- summarise(
  presidentialElections,
  mean_dem_vote = mean(demVote),
  mean_other_parties = mean(other_parties_vote)
)
average_votes

# summarise(df, new_column_name1 = function(column),
#                new_column_name2 = function(column))

## You can use for any summary function:
## mean()
## median()
## max()
## min()
## sd() for standard deviations
## n() for frequencies
## sum() for totals

## DIY: QUESTIONS with summarise  ----



# Why does this code not show the mean?
# Answer:
summarise(weather,
            mean = mean(temp),
            std_dev = sd(temp))

# na.rm = TRUE is an argument of both mean() and sd(), removing all NA values
summarise(weather,
           mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
          std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))

# you can also use na.omit() function with the pipe operator |>  as we will see later...

## ADVANCED (OKAY TO SKIP) Your own functions ----

## You can create your own function using the function() {} code
## We'll look at making functions later on

## A function that returns furthest from 50
furthest_from_50 <- function(vec){
  # subtract 50 from each value
  adjusted_values <- vec - 50

  # return the element with the largest absolute difference from 50
  vec[abs(adjusted_values) == max(abs(adjusted_values))]
}

# summarise the df, generating a column 'biggest_landslide'
# that stores the value furthest from 50%

summarise(
  presidentialElections,
  biggest_landslide = furthest_from_50(demVote)
)



## Combining dplyr functions ----

## more complex analyses often requires combining functions
## Taking the result of one function, and putting it into another
## Three appraoches
## A Use intermediary variables - like stepping stones
## B Use nested functions - like Excel functions
## C Use the pipe operator - like humans read and think

## Question - which state had the highest percentage of votes for Obama in 2008?
## Simple question, but requires some steps:
## Filter the df to only observations from 2008
## Of the percentages in 2008, filter down to the highest percentage
## Select the name of the state

## A. Use a sequence of steps

## 1. Filter down to only 2008 votes
votes_2008 <- filter(presidentialElections, year == 2008)

## 2. Filter down to the state with the highest demVote
most_dem_votes <- filter(votes_2008, demVote == max(demVote))

## 3. Select the name of the state
most_dem_state <- select(most_dem_votes,state)

## Pros - easy to read and understand later
## Cons - you create a lot of new variables which soon clutter up your Environment

## B. Use nested functions

most_dem_state <- select(filter(filter(presidentialElections, year == 2008), demVote == max(demVote)), state)
## So many parantheses!

## Let's break it down
most_dem_state <- select( # 3. select the name of the state
  filter( # 2. Filter down to the state with the highest demVote
    filter( # 1. Filter down to only 2008 votes
      presidentialElections, # Arguments for step 1 'filter'
      year == 2008
    ),
    demVote == max(demVote) # second argument for step 2 'filter'
  ),
  state # # second argument for step 3 'select'
)


## Pros - no need to create redundant variables
## Cons - not easy to read or understand later; easy to miscalculate the order

## C. The Pipe Operator ----

## The pipe operator is written as |>,
## It has a shortcut of control-shift-m / command-shift-m in RStudio
## It takes the result of one function, and passes it as the first argument to the next

## Same question as above using the pipe operator:

presidentialElections |> # start with the df
  filter(year == 2008) |> # 1. Filter down to only 2008 votes
  filter(demVote == max(demVote)) |> # 2. Filter down to the state with the highest demVote
  select(state) # 3. select the name of the state

## I often check if the pipe chain works first
## then just add the new object name afterwards

most_dem_state <- presidentialElections |> # start with the df
  filter(year == 2008) |> # 1. Filter down to only 2008 votes
  filter(demVote == max(demVote)) |> # 2. Filter down to the state with the highest demVote
  select(state) # 3. select the name of the state

## Pros: Easy to read and understand later; no redundant variables
## Cons: Don't forget to put the pipe at the end of a line!


## DIY: compare these two: ----
weather |>
  summarise(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  summarise(std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))

weather |>
  summarise(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
  std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))

## Why does the first one produce error message?
#Answer:



## group_by ----
## <SEE SLIDE 21-22>
## summarise is most powerful when used in combination with another function - group_by()
## group_by() lets you group rows together so that you can summarise the grouped data for
## things like mean(), sd(), sum(), n() etc

# Group observations by state
## <SEE SLIDES 35, 36>
group_by(presidentialElections, state)

# Group observations by state using the pipe
grouped <- presidentaElections |> group_by(state)

## Returns a grouped_df Type object in the Environment pane

## The grouped df does not look too special, but now you can apply other dplyr verbs
## onto the grouped date

# Compute average percentages across the years by state
state_voting_summary <- presidentialElections |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(
    mean_dem_vote = mean(demVote),
    mean_other_parties = mean(other_parties_vote)
  )

## DIY: Make a new df called freq_dest ----
## take the flights dataset
## group by destination
## summarise the number of flights with n(), call the variable num_flights


## Arrange the freq_dest df so that num_flights is in descending order


## Joining dataframes ----
## <SEE SLIDES 26-28>
# Create first example data frame

## DIY CHALLENGE - join airports with freq_dest df to find out the airport names ----
## use select to end up with only a 3 column df with dest, name and num_flights

## CODE PLANNING

## first glimpse at the data, identify the important variables

## next join the dfs, then select columns of interest

## join planes and flights first to match up seats with distance (use by = … for safety)

## join new df with airlines to match up carrier with airline names

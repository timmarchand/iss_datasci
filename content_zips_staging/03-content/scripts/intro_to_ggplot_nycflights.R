## Clear the workspace and load the packages ----
## It is a good idea to start a new R session with a blank slate
## Note the best way to do this to change your Global Options...

# this code removes everything from your workspace
# Uncomment the code to run it - but be careful, and only do so if certain!
# rm(list=ls())

## Load the packages
## you may need to use install.packages() first
library(nycflights13) # for the data
library(dplyr) # for manipulating the data
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(readr) # to read in data
library(gridExtra) # to put plots together

## Alternative with pacman::p_load()
pacman::p_load(nycflights13,dplyr,ggplot2,readr,gridExtra)

## Advantages:
## One line of code, put all the packages inside the brackets
## Automatically installs packages you don't have yet
## "Quiet" - avoids unnecessary messages

## Scatterplots ----
# Scatterplots allow you to visualise the relationship between two numerical variables
## Using the flights dataframe included in the  nycflights13 package, 
# let's visualise the relationship between departure delay on the x axis and arrival delay on the y axis 
# for all Alaska Airlines flights.

## Filter only the Alaskan airlines flights using dplyr functions, create a new df from the result
alaska_flights <- flights |> 
  filter(carrier == "AS")


## Question: Compare the new df (alaska_flights) with the original (flights) using View() or glimpse(). ----
# How are they different? 

## Note 3 ways of using View:
# 1 View()
# 2 Click on the table icon in the Environment pane
# 3 Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click) on name of object in Source pane

## Scatterplots using geom_point
## Most ggplots are built up with lines of code, each responding to a layer of the graph. 
# The first line includes the function itself, and you specify the data you want to use, 
# and what kind of aesthetic mapping you want - 
# which means what should be on the x axis and what on the y axis.

## First line of code - but no layers!
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay))


## We add a layer to the ggplot() call using the + sign at the end of a line
## For scatter plots, the geometric object you want o use is geom_point()
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()

## Questions: What kind of relationship exists between dep_delay and arr_delay? Are you surprised? Why? Why not? ----
## Why do you think there is a cluster of points near (0, 0)? What does (0, 0) correspond to in terms of the Alaska Air flights?

## Overplotting ----
## Because there are a lot of points near 0,0 on the graph, it is hard to tell the true number of points - this is called overplotting.

## Two ways to deal with it: adjust the transparency of the points by setting the alpha argument in geom_point
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) # 0.2 represents 20% transparency

## The darker points now show where there is overplotting



## second option, use jitter to nudge the points slightly apart
## note the code is very similar to geom_point above!
ggplot(data = alaska_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30) # use width and height to control how much to jitter


## Question: After using the alpha argument, guess the approximate range of arrival delays and departure delays that occur most frequently. Could you make the same guess without the transparent points? ----

## Extra practice on scatterplots and the nettle data ----

## Nettle (1999) discusses the interesting idea that linguistic diversity is correlated with climate factors:
## Countries with more fertile land have more languages than those with more ecological risk, because local people have less need to travel and so local languages develop over time. 

##Nettle measured ecological risk by mean growing season (MGS column in the data), which is how many months per year one can grow crops.


## Don't forget to read in the data from somewhere (read_csv()).
## If the nettle.csv is in your data folder, the following will work:

nettle <- read_csv("data/nettle.csv")
## Add your own comments to describe what you see
ggplot(nettle, aes(x = MGS, y = Langs)) +
  geom_point()

# Use geom_text() to replace the points with names of countries
# Swapping geom_point() with geom_text() returns an error:

ggplot(nettle, aes(x = MGS, y = Langs)) +
  geom_text()

# Because this geom needs an additional mapping, it ...
# ...needs to know which column contains the text to plot!

ggplot(nettle, aes(x = MGS, y = Langs, label = Country)) +
  geom_text()

# To save the latest ggplot, just type:
ggsave('nettle.png', width = 8, height = 6)

# It has now been saved into the same location as the R script
# You can move it using the Files pane interface:
# Select the plot with a check mark
# Click on More
# Choose Move...
# Select the destination folder

# Another way to do this is by using the relative path:

# figures/ --> select the figures folder
# nettle.png  --> add the file name and extension
ggsave('figures/nettle.png', width = 8, height = 6)

# To create a double-plot, first save each plot:

plot1 <- ggplot(nettle) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = MGS, y = Langs))

plot2 <- ggplot(nettle,
                aes(x = MGS, y = Langs, label = Country)) +
  geom_text()

# Then use 'gridExtra' to create double-plot:

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol = 2) # ncol = 2 -->  put the plots into 2 columns
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, nrow = 2) # nrow = 2 -->  put the plots into 2 rows


## Linegraphs ----
# Linegraphs show the relationship between two numerical variables when the variable on the x-axis 
# is sequential - this usually means you often see time on the x-axis.
# Let’s illustrate linegraphs using another dataset in the nycflights13 package: the weather data frame.

## Explore the weather data frame by running View(weather) and glimpse(weather).
weather
## Checkout the associated help file by running ?weather to bring up the help file.

# There is a variable called temp of hourly temperature recordings in Fahrenheit at weather stations 
# near airports in NYC: Newark (origin code EWR), John F. Kennedy International (JFK), and LaGuardia (LGA).

# Let's focus on early January temperatures in Newark, by filtering and creating a new df 
early_january_weather <- weather |>
  filter(origin == "EWR" & month == 1 & day <= 15)

## Question: Compare the new df with the original using View() or glimpse(). ----
# How are they different? 







## Linegraphs via gemom_line----
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, # using our new dataframe as the data
       mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + # set x-axis as time_hour variable, and y to temperature
  geom_line() # added a line as the geometric layer of the plot 




## Histograms ----
## Histograms are a great way to see how a variable is distributed:
# 1. What are the smallest and largest values?
# 2. What is the “center” or “most typical” value?
# 3. How do the values spread out?
# 4. What are frequent and infrequent values?

# A histogram is a plot that visualizes the distribution of a numerical value as follows:

# 1. We first cut up the x-axis into a series of bins, where each bin represents a range of values.
# 2. For each bin, we count the number of observations that fall in the range corresponding to that bin.
# 3. Then for each bin, we draw a bar whose height marks the corresponding count.

# Unlike with scatterplots and linegraphs, there is now only one variable being mapped in aes(): 
# a single numerical variable. The y-aesthetic of a histogram, the count of the observations in each bin, 
# gets computed for you automatically.


## Let's look again at how the temp variable is distributed in the weather df
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Warnings: 
# R chose 30 bins by default
# One NA value was removed

## Try again, but add white borders to the bins to make it easier to see
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")

## Change the color of the bars using the fill argument
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "steelblue") 

## remember: color--> defines the color of the lines
##           fill --> defines the color filling the shape


## Adjusting the bins of a histogram ----
# Two ways to adjust the bins in a histogram:

# 1. By adjusting the number of bins via the bins argument to geom_histogram().
# 2. By adjusting the width of the bins via the binwidth argument to geom_histogram().

# 1. Tell R how many bins to use, override the default 30 bins
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, color = "white")


#2. Tell R the width of the bin (i.e. how many degrees temperature in the range of the bin)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "white")


## Density plots as an alternative ----

## Taking the original histogram we plotted, rather than show a count on the y-axis, let's divide the count by the total of all the counts
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp,
                                     y = after_stat(count/sum(count)))) +
  geom_histogram()

## This gives us the proportion of counts for each binwidth, with the largest value about 0.064, or 6.4%
## Note that the total of all the proportions should equal 1, or 100%

## A density plot is an extension of this idea, and visualizes the underlying probability distribution of the data by drawing an appropriate continuous curve
# It shows the probability density function of the variable, and can be seen like to be a smoothed version of the histogram  

## For density plots, we use the geom_density function:

ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_density(fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.4) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of temperatures around New York airports") +
  theme_minimal()

## remember: color--> defines the color of the lines
##           fill --> defines the color filling the shape

## using hex color codes from: https://imagecolorpicker.com/color-code/69b3a2
## alternative use Colors option in Excel etc


## Facets ----
# Faceting is used when we’d like to split a particular visualization by the values of another variable. 
# This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, 
# but whose content will differ.

ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ month) # note the tilde symbol - found next to the = sign on many Japanese keyboards

# Tell R the number of rows or columns you want using the nrow or ncol arguments
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ month, nrow = 4)

# Question: What do all the numbers represent on the plot? ----

## Boxplots ----

# Faceted histograms are one type of visualization used to compare the distribution of a numerical variable split by the values of another variable
# Another type of visualization that achieves this same goal is a side-by-side boxplot

# Let's try looking at temperatures by month in the weather data:
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Warning messages:
#   1: Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? 
#   2: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). 

# This means we have a continuous, numerical variable on the x axis - but it needs to be categorical.
# In R, categorical variables are called factors, and you can simply convert the months using factor().

ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# The “box” parts represent the 1st quartile, the median (the 2nd quartile), and the 3rd quartile.

# The height of each box (the value of the 3rd quartile minus the value of the 1st quartile) is the interquartile range (IQR).

# It is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of values, with longer boxes indicating more variability.

# The “whisker” portions of these plots extend out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes and  represent points from the minimum to the 25th percentile and from the 75th percentile to the maximum value respectively, unless there are outliers. 


# The length of these whiskers show how the data outside the middle 50% of values vary, with longer whiskers indicating more variability.

# The dots representing values falling outside the whiskers are called outliers. If outliers are present, the whisker on the appropriate side is drawn to 1.5 * IQR rather than the data minimum or the data maximum. 


## PLay around with mpg dataset ----

## ggplot2 packages comes with the mpg dataset, which is featured in many tutorials on R
mpg

## try to experiment on  data visualisation with this dataset (remember it's okay to copy, paste and tweak!)

## when reflecting on this week's code, you can add a code chunk in your weekly_notes (Ctrl+ALT+I on Windows, Cmd+Opt+I on Mac) if you want to show off what you discovered
